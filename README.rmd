# Purpose

This folder is a suggested solution to the mock assignment. This README is not as detailed as you can go - I want to get across the code and loading it, more than the description of what I do.

I want you to note how I construct this folder - creating functions for all the operations, placing them in the code folders in each question and sourcing them where appropriate.

You don't have to follow this exact workflow, but there is merits in keeping your questions and their code in separate folders.

This README (the root's README), however, is the one that I will be looking at and grading. So ensure your codes are sourced in here appropriately and figures and / or tables displayed here properly.

Convince yourself about how and why I do what I do in this folder-  no memorizing please, it must make sense.

The idea is that each Question's folder works on a standalone basis - with the root folder collating it all and detailing what happens in each question.

> Please make sure that you understand how to create the Texevier html and pdf templates.

### How to get started

I used the following code to start off:

```{r, eval = F}

CHOSEN_LOCATION <- "C:/Users/nico/DataScience/Mock_Assignment/"
fmxdat::make_project(FilePath = glue::glue("{CHOSEN_LOCATION}Solution/"), 
                     ProjNam = "14623579")

Texevier::create_template(directory = glue::glue("{CHOSEN_LOCATION}Solution/14623579/"), template_name = "Question1")
Texevier::create_template(directory = glue::glue("{CHOSEN_LOCATION}Solution/14623579/"), template_name = "Question2")

```


# Question 1 solution

Note - try not to spend too much time on the write-up part. I just want to check the formatting and layout, and whether you can successfully write something in Texevier. Focus on the data-wrangling, function building and sourcing and the visuals. It is less of an essay, more of a show of your ability to use Texevier.

## Code used for Figures and Tables

You must detail the steps in building your Texevier pdf as below.

```{r}

gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, lubridate)

# Source in all your functions:
# walk is the 'silent' version of map, which is similar to lapply.
list.files('Question1/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))


```


### Data

I put the unzipped data files in their respective question folders.

For loading in the README - adjust the code.

### Question 1

#### Loading the data

```{r}
# See why the parameter Datroot was useful now?
datcolat <- Data_Collating(Datroot = "Question1/Data/Happy/")

```


#### First plot

I can describe this plot as follows...

It shows that ....

For the below, I had to adjust the sizes to fit into the readme a bit.

```{r}

g <- Error_bar_plot(datcolat, xaxis_size = 9, xaxis_rows = 3)
g

```

The second plot in the paper ...

```{r}

  g <-  Barplot_breakdown_Happy_Contributors(datcolat, Title = "Barplot making up the ladder", Subtitle = "Look at the colours - wow.", xaxis_size = 9, xaxis_rows = 3)
    
g

```



### Question 2

```{r}

if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

list.files('Question1/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
list.files('Question2/code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))

# Data loading:
    Loc <- "Question2/data/Wine/"
    dff <- read_rds(glue::glue("{Loc}WineMag.rds"))
    Fruitlist <- read_table("Question2/data/wine/Fruitlist.txt")
    froots <- Fruitlist$Fruits  %>% unique %>% as.list()
    CountryList <- c("South Africa", "Italy", "France", "US", "Spain")

    dff_adj <- dff %>% filter(country %in% CountryList)

```



### First plot

Some description here would be great.

```{r}
fruit_count <- froots %>% map_df(~Fruit_extractor(dff_adj, froots = .))
g <- First_fruits_plot(fruit_count, xaxis_rows = 2, xaxis_size = 5)
g
```



### Table

Note that for the table function, I added a Latex argument so that it can build in html form for use in README.


```{r, message=FALSE}
Tab <- Term_refs_table(dff_adj, Latex = FALSE)
Tab

```



### Second plot

```{r, message=FALSE}
Tasters <- c( "Lauren Buzzeo" , "Susan Kostrzewa")
df_SA <-
    dff %>% filter(country %in% "South Africa", price > 50, taster_name %in% Tasters)

gg <- Top_5_Wineries_SA_Plot(df_SA, Tasters)
gg

```


### Regression plot

Short overview

```{r, message=FALSE}
Regression_Plot(df_SA)

```


### Question 3

See if you can tackle this question yourself.


### Question 4

See the Question3 folder - I get you started there on a data wrangling function.

There's some nice tips and tricks in there, please go through all the lines.
