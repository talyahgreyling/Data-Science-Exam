    # The following is a great summary in how to split strings that are not vanilla...
    # Aim: we want to split the score into the amount of games played - in order to assess how frequently e.g. aces are hit.
    # Naturally, more sets mean more aces, and tournaments with more sets mean more aces - so let's first count the amount of serving games - dividing it by two to crudely proxy for amount of services games played...
    # You'd typically start by trying to 'str_split' a vector until it works, and try and get a tough one.
    # E.g. 7-6(3) states that the set was won in a tie breaker, so we want to drop the brackets to sum the games...
