# Purpose

Illustrate workthrough of practical question

```{r}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(tidyverse);library(lubridate);library(rmsfuns)
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% .[grepl('.R', .)] %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
```


```{r}

Lst <- 
    list.files("data/Tennis/", full.names = T) %>% 
    .[grepl("atp_matches", .)] %>% 
    # I don't want to look at doubles - cos Nadal no play double.
    .[!grepl("doubles", .)] %>% as.list()

# Join player info by id:
    playerinfo <-
        read_rds("data/Tennis/atp_players.rds") %>% select(player_id, hand, height)

    # The following function reads in the player information in a concise, silent manner.
    # My thinking here is to....
    
# I want to only look at Grandslams, Masters and Finals - use Tournament_Inputs to filter.
result_Large_events <- Data_Prep_Function(Lst, Tournament_Inputs = c("G", "M", "F"))

```


Nadal vs Djokovic at grandslam and master's events: 

 * against top 5 players
 
 * against low-ranking players - efficiency of seeing them off
 
 * Time taken, ace percentage, breakpoints won (showing BMT)
 
 Let's see what we can extract from the data easily..
 
 
```{r}

# Note the function used - it has a few tips and tricks!

Result <- 
    c("Rafael Nadal", "Roger Federer", "Andy Murray", "Novak Djokovic", "Frank Tom") %>% as.list() %>% 
    map_df(~Winsummary_Function_Compiler(result_Large_events,
                                 Player_Name = .,
                                 playerinfo, 
                                 Top_N = 5,
                                 Silent = F))

Result %>% View

 
```

 

## Now - let's look at the current top ranking players, and get their stats to place Djokovic and Nadal into broader perspective:

```{r}
# Find top 100 from last Grandslam (try find this yourself with logic first...):
Current_Top_100 <- 
    bind_rows(
    result_Large_events %>% filter(tourney_level == "G", date == last(date)) %>% select(winner_id, winner_rank) %>% filter(!is.na(winner_rank)) %>% purrr::set_names("ID", "rank"),
    result_Large_events %>% filter(tourney_level == "G", date == last(date)) %>% select(loser_id, loser_rank) %>% filter(!is.na(loser_rank)) %>% purrr::set_names("ID", "rank")
    ) %>% unique %>% arrange(rank)

Players_Fetch <- 
    left_join(Current_Top_100, 
              result_Large_events %>% select(winner_name, winner_id) %>% unique %>% purrr::set_names("Name", "ID" ),
              by = "ID") %>% filter(!is.na(Name)) %>% arrange(desc(rank)) %>% 
    filter(rank <= 100)

List_Fetch <- 
    Players_Fetch %>% 
    pull(Name) %>% as.list()

Top100_Result <- 
    List_Fetch %>% 
    map_df(~Winsummary_Function_Compiler(result_Large_events,
                                 Player_Name = .,
                                 playerinfo, 
                                 Top_N = 5,
                                 Silent = F))


    Top100_Result <- 
        left_join(Top100_Result, 
                  Players_Fetch %>% select(Player = Name, rank), by = "Player")


Top100_Result %>% View

```

# Now - you can create some simple plots to do your analyses from...
