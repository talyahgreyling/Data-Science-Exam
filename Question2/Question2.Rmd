# Overview

In this report, we look at what Sommeliers prefer globally, and specifically the frequency with which references to fruity flavours are made.

Important note - some of the chunks take long to build. You can add cache=TRUE to the top part of a chunk - which means unless you adjust the chunk's code in any way, it will save the output and load it quickly. This makes building your pdf quicker.


We will also consider the local wine reviews from two prominent critics.

### Fruit reference count

In order to get insight into how often fruits are mentioned in reviews, and also which fruits are mentioned most - we collated a list of fruits and sought to identify the ....

We see that Plums are most referenced, with critics in Spain most regularly referencing fruits in their reviews:

```{r,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "References to Fruits by Sommeliers\\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}

# Count fruit references, by mapping the Fruit_extractor function across the different fruitlist 
# Remember ~ before function:
fruit_count <- froots %>% map_df(~Fruit_extractor(dff_adj, froots = .))
g <- First_fruits_plot(fruit_count, xaxis_rows = 2, xaxis_size = 5)
g
```



```{r}
# grepl needs "|", e.g. grepl("X|Y|Z", string)
collapsed_fruitlist <- paste(Fruitlist$Fruits, collapse = "|")

N_Refs_Fruit <- dff_adj %>% filter(!country %in% "Spain") %>% summarise(N = sum(grepl( collapsed_fruitlist, description))/ n()) %>% pull(N)

N_Refs_Fruit_spain <- dff_adj %>% filter(country %in% "Spain") %>% summarise(N = sum(grepl( collapsed_fruitlist, description))/ n()) %>% pull(N)

```

For the following, I used my discretion and added some further insight into the fruit referncing exercise. This could've been a plot, but let's practice referencing in text.

Spanish wines have far greater references to fruit, at `r round(N_Refs_Fruit_spain*100, 3)`%  of references mentioning fruits, compared to 
`r round(N_Refs_Fruit*100, 2)`% of reviews for `r glue::glue_collapse( CountryList[!grepl("Spain", CountryList)], sep = ", ", last = " and ")`.

### Referencing certain terms

Some text some text some text

Here is the table I asked for. Carefully note the code for doing this. I commented out some code and added the Tab_Span_Page function for if you were using Texevier.

Texevier's tables can be more involved as it loads various Latex packages to make nicer tables. For other Latex templates, you may not be able to produce similar tables - so for this we stick to plain old xtable - but take note of my commented out suggestions.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
Term_refs_table(dff_adj)

```

Of course, you could do more with Table \ref{tab1}, but I just want to get you started above.


Lastly, let's look at South Africa in a new section.

# South Africa

```{r,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Local Wine Reviews: Top Wineries locally.\\label{Figure2}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}

Tasters <- c( "Lauren Buzzeo" , "Susan Kostrzewa")
df_SA <-
    dff %>% filter(country %in% "South Africa", price > 50, taster_name %in% Tasters)

gg <- Top_5_Wineries_SA_Plot(df_SA, Tasters)
gg
```

From Figure \ref{Figure2}, note the most preferred wineries. You can discuss a bit further here.

```{r}
Corr <- 
df_SA %>% filter(price > 10) %>% 
  group_by(taster_name) %>% summarise(Corr = cor(price, points, method = "spearman", use = "pairwise.complete.obs"))

```

In terms of correlations, note the correlations between prices and reviews for Lauren Buzzeo (`r Corr %>% slice(1) %>% pull(Corr) %>% round(.,3)*100`%) and Susan Kostrzewa (`r Corr %>% slice(2) %>% pull(Corr) %>% round(.,3)*100`%).


We can further run regressions on what determines determines points based on our dataset. You can now add a few sentences describing this a bit.

```{r,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Local point determinants.\\label{Figure3}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}

Regression_Plot(df_SA)

```

Figure \ref{Figure3} can be discussed here in more detail.
